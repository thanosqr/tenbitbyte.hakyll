title: About
---

I'd live in a small hut in the mountains of Kumano Kodō, on Kii Hantō, had I not been so fond of London.
I enjoy languages, programming, natural, and constructed alike, go, the game, not the language, tea, and ambiguously delimited sentences.
I also like test-driven development, iterative design, and finding the right problem to solve.
